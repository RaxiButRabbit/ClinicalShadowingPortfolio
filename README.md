# Clinical Shadowing Portfolio

## Overview
Welcome to my Clinical Shadowing Portfolio, a collection of de-identified notes documenting my shadowing experiences as a premed student with a computer science background. This repository showcases my exposure to clinical settings, including anesthesia and pulmonary critical care medicine, through detailed observations, medical terminology, and reflections on patient care and interdisciplinary teamwork. The records are intended to demonstrate my commitment to pursuing a medical career and my ability to integrate clinical and technical skills.

All notes are fully de-identified to comply with HIPAA and institutional privacy standards, removing clinician names, specific locations, and patient details. The portfolio is designed for medical school applications, professional development, and sharing with mentors, reflecting my growth in understanding healthcare delivery.

## Contents
- **Anesthesia Shadowing**: Notes from observing anesthesia management in orthopedic procedures, including induction, monitoring, and patient safety protocols.
  - Example: `Critical_Care_Shadowing_09152025.md` (observation of extracorporeal support and transthoracic echocardiogram in critical care).
- **Critical Care Shadowing**: Records of pulmonary and critical care observations, focusing on diagnostic imaging (e.g., TTE) and discussions on palliative care.
- **Future Additions**: Planned inclusion of additional de-identified notes from ongoing shadowing in various medical specialties.

## Background
As a premed student with a computer science background, I bring a unique perspective to clinical shadowing, combining technical precision (e.g., experience with Python, algorithms, and cybersecurity) with a passion for patient-centered care. My shadowing experiences at academic medical centers have deepened my understanding of medical procedures, teamwork, and ethical considerations, preparing me for medical school and a career in healthcare.

## Usage
These notes are intended for educational purposes, showcasing clinical exposure and reflective learning. They may be reviewed by medical school admissions committees, mentors, or peers interested in premed clinical experiences. All records are anonymized to ensure privacy and compliance with ethical standards.
